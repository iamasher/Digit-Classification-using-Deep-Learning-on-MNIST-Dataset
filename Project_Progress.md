- **Last Updated**: 13-Feb-2025  
- **Completion Percentage**: 100%  

---

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Finalized the project topic and objectives.  
- [x] Assigned project roles and responsibilities.  
- [x] Completed writing the project synopsis/documentation.  
- [x] Implemented data preprocessing (grayscale conversion, normalization, and reshaping).  
- [x] Built and trained the **CNN model** on the MNIST dataset.  
- [x] Tuned hyperparameters and optimized model performance.  
- [x] Evaluated model accuracy and generated visualizations (confusion matrix, accuracy/loss graphs).  
- [x] Tested predictions on **custom images** using OpenCV and PIL.  
- [x] Deployed the trained model for digit recognition.  
- [x] Prepared **final presentation slides** for project review.

## Notes
- The project has been successfully implemented, and the model is functioning as expected.  
- The trained CNN model achieves high accuracy on both the MNIST dataset and custom images.  
- All reports and documentation are completed.  
- The final step is to present the project findings and results to our professor.  
- **Next milestone**: Project Presentation & Submission ðŸŽ¯
