# Contributors Guide

Welcome to the Digit Classification project! We appreciate your contributions and effort to improve this project.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**:  
   If you want to contribute, first fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a Branch**:  
   After forking, create a new branch for your changes. For example:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   This will ensure that your changes are separated from the main codebase.

3. **Make Your Changes**:  
   Implement the changes or add new features in your branch. Ensure that you are following the project structure and best practices.

4. **Commit Your Changes**:  
   After making the necessary changes, commit them to your branch. Write clear and concise commit messages.

   Example:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added custom image for testing"
   ```

5. **Push the Changes**:  
   Push your changes to your GitHub fork:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:  
   Once your changes are pushed to your fork, open a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch of the original repository. Be sure to describe the changes you made in the PR description.

## Important Notes

- **Do Not Make Changes Directly in the `main` Branch**:  
   All changes should be made in a separate branch. The `main` branch should remain clean and stable. Please follow the branching strategy outlined above.
   
- **Reviewing PRs**:  
   Once your pull request is submitted, the project maintainers will review the changes. If everything looks good, your PR will be merged into the main branch.

Thank you for contributing!
